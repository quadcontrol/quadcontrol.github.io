   - Install ARM Toolchain:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
   ```

### b) Verification

To confirm everything was installed correctly:

1. **Verify Make**
   ```bash
   make --version
   ```
   > ‚úÖ Should show Make version (e.g., GNU Make 4.3)

2. **Verify ARM Toolchain**
   ```bash
   arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
   ```
   > ‚úÖ Should show GCC version (e.g., arm-none-eabi-gcc 10.3.1)

## üêç 2. Python

Python is the main language we'll use to program the drone.

### a) Installation

1. **Download Python**
   - Go to [Python's official website](http://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119)
   - Download the Windows installer (64-bit)
   
2. **Run the installer**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Check the box `[‚úì] Add python.exe to PATH`
   - Click "Install Now"

### b) Verification

Run these commands in PowerShell to confirm installation:

```bash
python --version  # Should show Python 3.11.9
pip --version     # Should show pip version
```

## üïπÔ∏è 3. Crazyflie Client

The Crazyflie Client is the interface we'll use to control the drone.

### a) Installation

1. **Install the client via pip**
   ```bash
   pip install cfclient
   ```

### b) Verification

1. **Launch the client**
   ```bash
   cfclient
   ```
   > ‚úÖ Should open the Crazyflie graphical interface

## ‚ùì Common Issues

### WSL won't install
- Check if virtualization is enabled in BIOS
- Make sure Windows is up to date
- Run `sfc /scannow` in PowerShell as administrator

### Python not recognized
- Restart PowerShell/computer after installation
- Verify you checked "Add to PATH" during installation
- Add to PATH manually if needed
